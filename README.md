# ARassistant2016
## GOALS
We hope to achieve the following results:
Real-time rendering: quickly change the texture of a model
Suitable for AR: virtual model can be applied to real-world scenarios
Strong Interactivity: userâ€™s hand drawings can be presented by a 3D model

## IMPLEMENT
We developed this app on Unity5 and released it on the platform of PC. As for the implementation of AR, we use Vuforia 5SDK to recognize images. When the target for recognition is tracked, its sub-object will be displayed.
